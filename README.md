## Elevator Pitch
<p>This app serves two customers with complementary needs - Nonprofit Organizations and people who want to volunteer their time. </p>
<b> A Platform for Nonprofits </b>
<p>Many Nonprofit organizations have needs for an increased volunteer base and traditional outreach can often be too costly and time consuming with their limited resources. Voluntr provides a simple platform where a nonprofit can post a volunteer opportunity in seconds while the app takes care of the rest! </p>
<b> A Simple Resource for Volunteers </b>
<p>People looking to volunteer at a nonprofit often have barriers to being able to volunteer - limited time, limited knowledge of what opportunities are available, a desire to work with a specific group or mission, and more - and scouring the Internet alone can be inefficient and overwhelming. Voluntr will allow volunteers to search according to what's important to them and find opportunities and organizations that fit all of their needs in one quick and simple app!</p>
